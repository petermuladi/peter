# 🖐Hi there! 

I'm Péter Muladi, a junior web developer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications. As a recent graduate of Ruander Oktatási Kft. I bring a fresh perspective and a strong foundation in **PHP**, **MySQL**, **SQL**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, **REST API**, **OOP**, and **MVC** to my work.

My experience in backend development has taught me to approach complex problems with creativity and attention to detail, while my dedication to continuous learning keeps me up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies.

I am currently seeking opportunities to utilize my skills and contribute to a dynamic and innovative team. If you're looking for a dedicated web developer who can deliver high-quality results, please don't hesitate to contact me. Let's build something great together!
